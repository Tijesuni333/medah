            <p> The special day is here, a day to celebrate a graceful queen. You are every shade of an amazing woman. Words would never do justice to how precious you are to me.
                You have turned my life around in so short a time, filling my life with so much love.
                I pray this new age gifts you with everything beautiful and colourful.
                Happy birthday, queen.</p>

                It’s always a privilege to wake up to this date every year to celebrate the anniversary of your birth.
                On this day, I pray you sustain all your amazing and positive vibes.
                May so much good come to you this new age and every other day.

            <p>Close your eyes and think of everything perfect and beautiful, there’s no perfection yet you are so perfect.
                And on this day, the anniversary of your birth, I wish you all the good and perfect things life has to offer.
                It’s so amazing having you in my life, so on this occasion, gifts will not be enough, neither will words be.
                I love you baby girl, so wear your crown like the queen that you are and show the world what you have got.
                Happy birthday my queen.</p>
